### Hi there, I'm Fraser 👋

I'm currently working as a Data & Analytics Contractor. I specialise in Product Analytics and Business Insights, but I've also touched on Data Engineering work everywhere from startups to large enterprise companies, and will be starting a Data Science MSc in October 2022. 

For any data work, I'm fully booked until March 2022. But I also do **Frontend Web Development**. 

## 🥞 The Stack

### 🕷 Web Development

- Spent most of lockdown getting a solid foundation with **CSS**, and coming from a Python background I really like how modular **SASS** encourages you to be. More recently I've been getting into [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), feels very intuitive once you get used to it!
- My Javascript framework of choice is **Vue.js**
- **WordPress / PHP:** Such a useful tool, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!!

### 📈 Data & Analytics

- No surprises here - Python & SQL!
- I've also used AWS for a bunch of different projects. AWS Lambda for deploying ML models as API endpoints, Athena for querying a massive data lake, etc.
- The immediate users of most of my work are non-technical colleagues so I've also got a lot of use out of Tableau, Google Sheets, Sisense, etc.
