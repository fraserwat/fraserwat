### Hi there, I'm Fraser 👋

I'm currently working as a Data & Analytics Contractor. I specialise in Product Analytics and Business Insights, but I've also touched on Data Engineering work everywhere from startups to large enterprise companies.

For any data work, I'm fully booked until March 2022. But I also do **Frontend Web Development**. 

## 🥞 The Stack 🥞

### 🕷 Web Development 🕷

- Spent most of lockdown getting a solid foundation with **CSS**, and coming from a Python background I really like how modular **SASS** encourages you to be. More recently I've been getting into [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), feels very intuitive once you get used to it!
- My Javascript framework of choice is **Vue.js**
- **WordPress / PHP:** Such a useful tool, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!!

### 📈 Data & Analytics 📈

- No surprises here - Python & SQL!
- I've also used AWS for a bunch of different projects. AWS Lambda for deploying ML models as API endpoints, Athena for querying a massive data lake, etc.
- The immediate users of most of my work are non-technical colleagues so I've also got a lot of use out of Tableau, Google Sheets, Sisense, etc.
